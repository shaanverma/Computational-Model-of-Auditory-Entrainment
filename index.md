## Auditory Entrainment
* **Entrainment**: Synchronization of an oscillatory system(s) to an external rhythm/system
   * More efficient processing of stimuli
* Entrainment of auditory neurons depends on properties of input stimuli: amplitude (volume), frequency, and rhythm
* Entrainment is more likely to occur...
   * As stimulus frequency approaches intrinsic frequency and as stimulation intensity increases
* Plays an important role in auditory selective attention

## Results



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/shaanverma/Computational-Model-of-Auditory-Entrainment/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/shaanverma/Computational-Model-of-Auditory-Entrainment/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
